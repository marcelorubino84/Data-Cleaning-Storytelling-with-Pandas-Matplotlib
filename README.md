# Data Cleaning & Storytelling with Pandas & Matplotlib Overview:

#### The purpose of this project is to make sense of messy data given in CSV files and extract insight in order to answer some business questions.

* **Data cleaning and quality**: 4 files are cleaned and then transformed in order to answer some business questions
* **Data visualization**: Using matplotlib and seaborn to create plots that convey a clear message.

#### The main question:

* Is it beneficial for the company to discount products?

#### Aspects needed to clarify for business purposes:

* How products should be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis
* What is the distribution of product prices across different categories
* How many products are being discounted
* How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices
* How seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales
* How could data collection be improved
